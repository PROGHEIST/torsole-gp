# TODO for GP Bodies Component Updates

- [x] Update gp-bodies.ts to add loading state variable and set it to false after data loads.
- [x] Update gp-bodies.html to add skeleton loading placeholders when loading is true, and modify cards to be smaller with circular images.
- [x] Update gp-bodies.css to add styles for skeleton placeholders if needed.
- [x] Test the component to ensure loading state works and cards display correctly.
- [x] Remove the "अधिक माहिती" (More Info) button from gp-bodies.html
- [x] Update the position paragraph styling in gp-bodies.html to make it bold and green for highlighting
